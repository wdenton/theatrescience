\section{Instructions}

Please read this carefully.  It explains how the formatting in the score works, so you will know what to do and what to say.

\subsection*{Formatting}

Boxes have \textit{stage directions}, which are instructions to be followed but not spoken.

\tsdirectionforall{A bold box has directions for you to follow.}

\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
\fbox{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{A regular box has directions for other people.  Do not perform these.}}
\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}

% \setlength{\fboxrule}{1pt}

\tstechnical{A dashed box has technical cues, which are also in italics to set them apart. Only Q and R will act on them.}

Your dialogue may include very brief directions.  These are shown with square brackets and small caps: \direction{Like this}.

Your dialogue is in bold.  Here is an example.

\begin{quote}

L:  The show tonight is in the Great Hall at the Arts and Letters Club.

\textbf{\performerletter{\speaker}:  \direction{Pause 1} We will be making use of the whole space, in and around you, but no audience member will be involved in the show.}

M:  The performance will last about forty minutes.

\end{quote}

\subsection*{Pauses}

\direction{Pause 1} means pause for a count of one, which you might time by saying to yourself, ``One one thousand.''.  \direction{Pause 2} means pause for a count of two, which you might time by saying to yourself, ``One one thousand, two one thousand.''  \direction{Pause 4}, you can imagine, will seem fairly long.

Don't rush a pause.  The audience will wait for you.

\subsection*{Pronunciation}

Words that might be hard to pronounce have a phonetic pronunciation before them in square brackets, with capital letters indicating emphasis:

\begin{quote}

  Composer Arnold \pronounce{Schoenberg}{SHERN-berg}.

  Cage was a mushroom expert: a \pronounce{mycologist}{my-COLL-o-jist}.

\end{quote}


Only say the word once.

If you are unsure of the pronunciation, give it your best shot, but don't worry if you make a mistake.  Try again or just move on.  If the audience noticed, they will forget quickly.

``Fungi'' can be pronounced with a hard or soft \textit{g} and you can say the final \textit{i} so it sounds like ``ee'' or ``aye.''  We like to say it with a hard G so ``fungi'' sounds like ``funky.''

The John Cage composition \textit{4' 33''} should always be pronounced in full as ``four minutes and thirty-three seconds.''

\subsection*{For the musician}

We use the piano to help indicate when a new section begins.  You will see these instructions:

\directionbox{m}{Wait until everyone has stopped moving, then play a note.}

To play a note, do this:  pick any key on the piano, hit it hard, and keep pressing the key down until you can no longer hear any sound from it, even if performers start talking.  When you can't hear the note any more, wait a few more seconds to be sure, then lift your finger up.

Then follow the score and wait for the next scenario.

\speak{p}{This show is about a concept from the field of library and information science.  The concept is:  \textit{Authority is constructed and contextual.} }

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Authority is constructed and contextual.''}

\speak{p}{This comes from a field of librarianship called \textit{information literacy}.}

\speak{s1}{\textit{Literacy}, on its own, can be defined in a very simple way as being able to read and write.  But the world is a lot more complicated now than it was five thousand years ago.  There is writing all around us, on paper or on screens.}

\speak{s2}{There are many different kinds of literacies.  The equivalent with numbers is \textit{numeracy}.  Being able to read and follow maps is a kind of literacy. There is also \textit{digital literacy} and \textit{media literacy}. }

\speak{s3}{For librarians the key concept is \textit{information literacy}.  Here's a definition.  It's dense, but we'll break it down.}

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Information literacy is the set of \ldots''}

\directionbox{performers}{Note that some people move while P speaks.}

\directionbox{s1}{Follow the blue line and stop on the blue triangle.}

\directionbox{s2}{Follow the green line and stop on the green triangle.}

\directionbox{s3}{Follow the pink line to the blue line, then stop on the star.}

\directionbox{p}{Turn to face the screen, then read while the others move.}

\speak{p}{``Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning.''  \direction{Pause 1}  Citation.}

\speak{t1}{Association of College and Research Libraries.}

\speak{t2}{\textit{Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education}.}

\speak{t3}{2015.}

\speak{p}{In other words, information literacy is the ability to do these with information:}

\speak{t1}{Find.}

\speak{t2}{Use.}

\speak{t3}{Understand.}

\speak{t1}{Evaluate.}

\speak{t2}{Integrate.}

\speak{t3}{Share.}

\speak{p}{They don't have to all be done at the same time, or in that order.}

\speak{s1}{Just reading the news requires you to understand, evaluate and integrate, but the news is coming at you all the time, you don't have to go out and find it.}

\speak{s2}{And it happens in different contexts.  Helping a kid with a homework assignment about trees is a lot easier than understanding changes to provincial policy about the Green Belt, but the steps are the same.}

\speak{s3}{A lot depends on people.  Information resources don't have to be written down.  If they are written, they're written by people.  They could be on film or audio.  But sometimes they actually \textit{are} people.  We turn to others for information or advice or expertise.}

\directionbox{p}{Move along the yellow line to the X, then turn to face the screen.}

\speak{p}{Librarians used to think of information literacy as being very much about using computers to do research.  And they had long lists of specific tasks that people should be able to do.  But as they taught information literacy to students in colleges and universities, and as the world changed, they found this approach wasn't the best for:}

\speak{t1}{Find.}

\speak{t2}{Use.}

\speak{t3}{Understand.}

\speak{t1}{Evaluate.}

\speak{t2}{Integrate.}

\speak{t3}{Share.}

\speak{p}{So in 2016 a group wrote \textit{Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education}.  It has six ``frames.''  These frames are ``threshold concepts.''  That's the idea that there is a change that happens when you go from a beginner's understanding of something to seeing the big picture of how it all fits together, with all the nuances and subtleties. The six frames are these.}

\speak{s1}{Authority is constructed and contextual.}

\speak{s2}{Information creation as a process.}

\speak{s3}{Information has value.}

He wrote music for percussion, piano, tape, voice, small ensembles, and other instruments.  One piece is written for twelve radios, each played by two people: one controls the tuning and the other the volume and timbre.  Most famously, he used silence.}

\directionbox{s3}{Turn one-quarter to the left.}

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Information resources reflect'' paragraph with first line bold.}

\speak{p}{First of all, what's an information resource?  Define it, please.}

\speak{s1}{A book.  A web site.  A documentary.  A Facebook post.  An article in an academic journal.  A thread on Twitter.  A newspaper report.  A pamphlet your doctor gave you.  Could be a person!}

\speak{p}{How do they reflect their creators' expertise and credibility?}

\speak{s2}{The book was written by someone who's spent years on the topic, and it's published by a major publisher.  The web site has recipes tested by a cook you like.  The post on Facebook was made by someone who was actually at the event.}

\speak{s3}{The academic article is by a team of people at a research laboratory at a university.   The thread on Twitter is by a cabinet minister, about the government's response to an emergency.}

\speak{p}{And how you use these depends on what you need, when you need it, and how you'll use it.}

\speak{s1}{If I'm planning a vacation in a city I've never been to before, I'd go to some web sites, get some travel guides, and ask people I know if they've been there.  That's enough for me as a \textit{tourist}.  But if I was thinking about doing \textit{business} there, that's a whole different thing.  I need information about the economics, demographics, regulations and so on.}

\speak{s2}{Or say I had to write something about the Group of Seven.  If I want to check who the ninth and tenth members were, the Wikipedia entry is enough.  But if I'm studying Canadian art history at university, I need books by art historians and other experts.}

\speak{p}{Next part.}

\directionbox{performers}{Turn to look at the screen.}

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Information resources reflect'' paragraph with second line bold: ``Authority is constructed \ldots''}

\speak{p}{Authority isn't absolute.  Different people can recognize different types of authority in different situations.  It's socially constructed. }

\speak{s3}{People can select their own authorities, based on religion or politics or culture.  Some authorities have that position because of a role that is more or less universally respected, like nurses.  Or maybe it's about power, like the principal in an elementary school.}

\speak{p}{And the last part.}

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Information resources reflect'' paragraph with third line bold:  ``It is contextual in that \ldots''}

\speak{p}{If I want to know what A.J.~Casson was like as a person, someone who knew Cass---maybe a member here who used to have lunch with him, and visited his house to buy a painting---is one kind of authority.   But if I want to know about the influence the Group has had on Canadian art over the last century, that's a different context.  I'd want to talk to art historians.  Though that person who knew Cass could \textit{be} an art historian, and be an authority in two different ways.}

\technicalbox{r}{SLIDE: ``Authority is constructed and contextual''.}

\speak{p}{Two last things about this frame.  There are some things people who are getting better with this concept will do, such as:}

\speak{s1}{They will be able to define different types of authority, for example: subject expertise, societal position or personal experience.}

\speak{s2}{They know indicators that help determine an authority's credibility.}

\speak{s3}{They know that there may be scholars who are widely acknowledged as authorities in an area, but still be challenged by other scholars.}

\speak{p}{And they know they can develop their own authority, and that doing so comes with responsibilities.  Also, there are ways that people will think and act.  People who understand this frame will maintain an open mind.}

\speak{s1}{They will look for authoritative sources, and remember authority doesn't need to come from a university degree.}

\speak{s2}{They will be aware of who is saying someone is an authority, and why.}

\speak{s3}{They will be aware of their own attitudes and biases.}

\speak{p}{\direction{Pause 1} Now the beginning is in place.  We know about information literacy.}

\speak{p}{We start with his music.  We saw the score of \textit{4' 33''}.  If someone knows one thing about Cage, they know he composed a work of music where there is no music.  That is not an easy concept.  The piece has been attacked many times over the years.  Even his own mother was unsure.  After the premier, she said to composer Earle Brown, ``Now Earle, don't you think that John has gone too far this time?''}

% \speak{s1}{He arrived at it through years of work.  There was a lot of thought and intent behind it.  Even though his music could sound wild and difficult, it was made with care and deliberation.  He knew what he was doing.  And through his life he kept changing what he was doing.}

% \speak{s2}{Cage began to study and compose music in the early 1930s.  Early on he studied under the composer Arnold Schoenberg, who was impressed with Cage's work.  However, harmony was important to Schoenberg but not to Cage, and he soon moved on.  One of his early percussion pieces, ``Third Construction,'' is still commonly performed by ensembles today.}

% \speak{s3}{He invented the prepared piano.  By putting screws and bolts and weather stripping between the strings of a piano, when the keys are hit the sound produced is very different from a normal piano.  Cage said it was ``a percussion ensemble under the control of a single player.''}

% \speak{p}{This all sounds rather long, and will be broken up differently.  There will be one or two quotes from Cage about his approach to sound and music.}

% hard work
% good luck
% enormous talent

% His work was appreciated and he was becoming known.  In Chicago he met the surrealist painter Max Ernst, who invited him to come to New York and stay with him and his wife, Peggy Guggenheim.   Cage and his wife moved there and he had more success.  In 1942 he began to work with choreographer Merce Cunningham, and in 1943 he left his wife for him.

\speak{p}{John Cage became interested in mushrooms in 1954, when he was staying at a farmhouse.  He said:}

\speak{s1}{``I found myself living in small quarters with four other people, and I was not used to such lack of privacy, so I took to walking in the woods.  And since it was August, the fungi are the flora of the forest at that time.''}

\speak{s2}{``I was very involved with chance operations in music, and I thought it would just be a very good thing if I could get involved with something where I could not take chances.''}

\speak{p}{Cage quickly became an expert, so much so that four years later he won a lot of money on Italian TV.  While in Milan, on a concert tour, he went on a game show called \textit{Leave or Double}.  Contestants won money by answering questions on a specialty subject.  His was mushrooms.  He appeared several times, building up his winnings.  Finally he had one-and-a-half million \textit{lire}, and in his last appearance he took the risk of answering three more questions to either win five million \textit{lire} (about eight thousand dollars) or lose it all.}

\speak{s1}{For the first question, he was shown photographs of mushrooms and had to identify them.  He got each one correct.}

\speak{s2}{Next he was shown a photo of a particular mushroom and had to give its scientific name, the colour and shape of its spores, and the length and width of its spores.  He gave all the right answers.}

\speak{s3}{Finally he was asked to list the twenty-four types of white-spore mushrooms given in a standard text.  Cage said, ``I can enumerate the list alphabetically,'' and then did so.}

\speak{p}{Cage later said, ``That was the first consequential amount of money I'd ever earned.  It was two years later, in 1960, that I began to make some money with my music.''  Peggy Guggenheim converted his winnings into American money on the black market.}

\speak{p}{Mushrooms became a regular part of Cage's music and writing.  We are going to hear two stories from his 1959 work \textit{Indeterminacy}.}

\speak{s3}{My two colleagues are now going to perform ``Mushroom Verbatim.''  One after the other, they are going to put on those headphones and repeat what they hear.

\subsection{Scenario 6: Cage and authority} % 5 minutes

\playanote{}

\notewait{}

\speak{p}{Cage was an expert on mushrooms, but he wasn't \textit{just} an expert.  He was also an \textit{authority}, which is different.  Someone can be an expert without being an \textit{authority}.}

\speak{t1}{Authority.}

\speak{t2}{Constructed.}

\speak{t3}{Contextual.}

\speak{s1}{Cage began teaching mushroom identification at a university in New York.  This led to him helping to found the New York \pronounce{Mycological}{my-co-LOJ-ical} Society, which is still operating today.}

\speak{s2}{He had ``perhaps the most extensive private library ever compiled on the subject'' of mushrooms.  In 1960 he sold wild mushrooms to the Four Seasons restaurant in New York.}

\speak{s3}{Notable fact:  He never ate magic mushrooms.  He had no interest that kind of experience.}

\speak{p}{Cage was an \textit{authority} on mushrooms.  Definition again, please.}

\tstechnical{R: SLIDE: Show ``Information resources reflect'' paragraph.}

\speak{t1}{``Information resources reflect their creatorsâ expertise and credibility, and are evaluated based on the information need and the context in which the information will be used.''}

\speak{s1}{We know about his expertise and his credibility.  As for information needs, if you wanted to know about mushrooms, perhaps while out in the forest, he would be a great person to ask.}

\speak{t2}{``Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize different types of authority.''}

\speak{s2}{He was recognized by other mushroom lovers and researchers for his knowledge and his association work.}

\speak{t3}{``It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the level of authority required.''}

\speak{s3}{If you needed a genetic analysis of a fungus, you'd go to a researcher in a lab.  But if you needed to identify a mushroom you'd found in the forest, he could do it.  He could tell you if it was poisonous or not.  You could trust John Cage to stop you from dying from mushroom poisoning.}

\tstechnical{R: SLIDE: ``Authority is constructed and contextual.''}

\speak{p}{Cage was an authority on mushrooms.  What about music?  Here's some evidence from conceptual artist and musician Yoko Ono, who met Cage in New York in the early sixties.  She displays the independence shown in her art.  She said:  ``I did not immediately take to someone who was considered an authority of some kind.  I mean John Cage was already an authority in some ways, you know; people respected him.  I was just being a bit cynical.''}

% \speak{p}{John Rockwell.}

% \speak{s1}{``Under Mr. Cage's benign influence, younger composers felt free to be free, to dispense with presuppositions about what music is and music be and to explore where their instincts and interests and modern technology took them.''}

% \speak{s2}{``The result has been a lot of trivial trash, of course, but there have also been some masterpiece---usually sounding totally unlike Mr.~Cage's own music, healthily enough---and even whole movements (Minimalism, most prominently) that owe their very existence to Mr.~Cage's liberating example.''}

% \speak{s3}{``Curiously, however, that example has been conveyed primarily through Mr.~Cage's writings (above all the seminal collection \textit{Silence} of 1961 \ldots) and the general example of his personality.''}

% \speak{p}{Citation.}

% \speak{t1}{John Rockwell.  Or something expressing the same idea.}

% \speak{t2}{``The Impact and Influence of John Cage'', in \textit{The New York Times}.}

% \speak{t3}{1987.}

% \speak{p}{That article was written when a new series of recordings of Cage's music was being released.  But it quotes Cage: ``I myself do not use records.  I just listen to the sounds around wherever I happen to be.'' \direction{Pause 2}  As noted, Cage's life and writings are more influential that his musical methods.  Here is a quote from the autobiography of composer Philip Glass.}

\speak{p}{Cage's influence on younger musicians and artists wasn't just in the way he composed.  It also came from his writings, such as his 1961 book \textit{Silence}.  Composer Philip Glass read it.  He said:}

\speak{s1}{``The book \textit{Silence} was in my hands not long after it came out, and I would spend time with [two friends] talking and thinking about it.  As it turned out, it became a way that we could look at what Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Serra or almost anybody from our generation or the generation before us did, and we could understand it in terms of how the work existed in the world.''}

\speak{s2}{``The accepted idea when I was growing up was that the late Beethoven quartets or \textit{The Art of the Fugue} or any of the great masterpieces had a platonic identity---that they had an actual, independent existence.  What Cage was saying is that there is no such thing as an independent existence.''}

\speak{s3}{``The music exists between you---the listener---and the object you're listening to.  The transaction of it coming into being happens through the effort you make in the presence of that work.  The cognitive activity is the content of the work.''}

\speak{p}{Citation.}

\speak{t1}{Philip Glass.}

\speak{t2}{\textit{Words Without Music}.}

\speak{t3}{2015.}

\speak{p}{Cage influenced minimalism, conceptual art, Fluxus and other movements.  But though there are many people who admire him, there are even more people who don't.  To them his work is somewhere between an interesting curiosity or an absurdity that has nothing to do with what music is really about.}

\speak{s1}{Composers working at the same time as Cage, who also did ``new'' and sometimes difficult music, didn't always agree with him.  Pierre Boulez and Karl-Heinz Stockhausen thought his use of chance was misguided.  Luigi Nono said his work was ``profoundly reactionary'' (because it did not allow true creative liberty) and called Cage's followers ``products of a narcissistically coquettish pseudo-radicalism.''}

\speak{s2}{QUOTES FROM YOUTUBE HERE.}

\speak{s3}{Our own Betty Trott, professor emerita of philosophy at Ryerson, taught the silent piece in a course on the aesthetics of music.  She said, ``The aesthetics explanation was an attempt to focus on the silence, or `not music,' as part of composition.  Most students grasped the principle, but dismissed the result with the question, `Why is four minutes of audience noise of any interest at all?' \ldots Why, my students said, would you pay money to listen to other people sneeze?  Good question, I thought. Sometimes theory is best left on the page.''}

\speak{p}{Composer and critic Kyle Gann sums it up:}

\speak{s1}{``How to explain the fact that, for hundreds of composers, Cage remains one of the central musical figures of the mid-twentieth century, if not \textit{the} central one? ''}

\speak{s2}{``For thousands trained in American conservatories, Cage is merely a historical irritant, a charlatan against whom their teachers warned them.  For another type, Cage is a model, a basic paradigm for a composer's life.  In America, this is probably the most reliable distinction between what is called the Uptown composer (Uptown as in Manhattan) and the Downtown composer.''}

\speak{s3}{``Uptown composers mention Cage with anger or contempt or condescension; Downtown composers talk of him with reverence, respect, and seriousness.  Perhaps no other composer in history elicits such extremes of approval and disapproval.''}

\speak{p}{Citation.}

\speak{t1}{Kyle Gann.}

\speak{t2}{``No Escape from Heaven: John Cage as Father Figure,'' in \textit{The Cambridge Companion to John Cage}.}

\speak{t3}{2002.}

\speak{p}{Where do you fit in?  Maybe Cage \textit{is} an authority for you: you look to him for lessons about how to find and create music and art and life.  Or maybe he \textit{isn't} an authority for you: nothing of his work is an influence, and he and his followers are completely removed from your practice.}

\speak{s1}{In which case, you have different authorities.  Either way, the authority is constructed.  Different communities recognize different types of authority.  Cage is an authority at Soundscapes and the Music Gallery.  At Opera Atelier and Tafelmusik, he is not.}

\speak{s2}{And it's contextual.  Do you want to let ambient environmental sounds to be part of a performance?  That will lead you right to Cage.  If you want to perform a crowd-pleasing Mozart symphony, you will look elsewhere.}

\speak{s3}{You can make up your own mind about Cage's artistic expertise and whether it is useful for what you need.}

% Doesn't have to be about art and music.
% Perform any disciplined action.
% Quote about attention?

\speak{p}{What if you knew very little about John Cage before tonight?  Maybe you're unsure what to make of all this.  Whichever role you're in, we're going to give you some time to think about it.  And experience it.  \direction{Pause 1}  We're going to end the show with a performance of \textit{4' 33''}.}
