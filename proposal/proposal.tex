\section{What to expect}

We will be wearing a boiler suit (AW) and a lab coat (WD), and goggles for safety reasons.

We are going to ask the Stage Committee for two Club Nights.

You have this pamphlet in advance.  Please read it.  It explains what we are asking for and why.  There are no surprises.  Everything is planned ahead of time.  Our request embodies the nature and intent of our project.
