## CATR Theatre Science (July 2020)

[Williamson](https://www.ashleywilliamson.org) and [Denton](https://www.miskatonic.org/) looked forward to [Partition/Ensemble 2020](https://partitionensemble2020.com/) in May and workshopping *Theatre Science* with the [Canadian Association of Theatre Researchers](https://catracrt.ca/) and the [Société québécoise d'études théâtrales](https://sqet.org/).  For the reduced, relaxed, asynchronous virtual conference that has replaced the Montreal meeting, we offer:

* [CATR Theatre Science](files/CATR-Theatre-Science.mp3), an immersive audio experience (39 minute MP3, best heard on headphones)
* [CATR Theatre Science Script](/files/CATR-Theatre-Science-Script.pdf) (PDF)
